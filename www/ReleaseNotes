Changes in 3.0 beta1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* UPD: afpd: Performance tuning of read/write AFP operations. New option
       "afp read locks" (default: no) which disables that the server
       applies UNIX byte range locks to regions of files in AFP read and
       write calls.
* UPD: apple_dump: Extended Attributes AppleDouble support.
       (*BSD is not supported yet)

Changes in 3.0 alpha3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* NEW: afpd: Per volume "login message", NetAFP bug ID #18
* NEW: afpd: Cross-platform locking (share modes) on Solaris and derivates
       with Solaris CIFS/SMB server. Uses new Solaris fcntl F_SHARE share
       reservation locking primitives. Enabled by default, set global
       "solaris share reservations" option to false to disable it.
* NEW: ad: ad set subcommand for changing Mac metadata on the server
* UPD: unix charset is UTF8 by default
       vol charset is same value as unix charset by default
* UPD: .AppleDesktop/ are stored in $localstatedir/netatalk/CNID
       (default: /var/netatalk/CNID), databases found in AFP volumes are
       automatically moved
* FIX: afpd: Server info packet was malformed resulting in broken
       server names being displayed on clients
* FIX: afpd: Byte order detection. Fixes an error where Netatalk on
       OpenIndiana returned wrong volume size information.

Changes in 3.0 alpha2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* UPD: afpd: Store '.' as is and '/' as ':' on the server, don't
       CAP hexencode as "2e" and "2f" respectively
* UPD: afdp: Automatic name conversion, renaming files and directories
       containing CAP sequences to their not enscaped forms
* UPD: afpd: Correct handling of user homes and users without homes
* UPD: afpd: Perform complete automatic adouble:v2 to adouble:ea conversion
       as root. Previously only unlinking the adouble:v2 file was done as root
* UPD: dbd: -C option removes CAP encoding
* UPD: Add graceful option to RedHat init script
* UPD: Add --disable-bundled-libevent configure options When set to yes,
       we rely on a properly installed version on libevent CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS
       should be set properly to pick that up
* UPD: Run ldconfig on Linux at the end of make install
* FIX: afpd: ad cp on appledouble = ea volumes
* FIX: dbd: ignore ._ appledouble files
* REM: Volumes options "use dots" and "hex encoding"
