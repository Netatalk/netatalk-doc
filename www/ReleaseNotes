Netatalk 2.2alpha2
==================
The Netatalk development team is proud to announce version 2.2alpha2 of
the Netatalk File Sharing suite. This is an unstable version, published
for the sole purpose of receiving wider testing. Do not run this on
production systems.

Netatalk is a freely-available Open Source AFP fileserver. It also
provides a kernel level implementation of the AppleTalk Protocol Suite.
A *NIX/*BSD system running Netatalk is capable of serving many Macintosh
clients simultaneously as an AppleShare file server (AFP), AppleTalk
router, *NIX/*BSD print server, and for accessing AppleTalk printers via
Printer Access Protocol (PAP).
Included are a number of minor printing and debugging utilities.

The suite contains:

* afpd - a file server that implements the Apple Filing Protocol, allowing
  clients running MacOS to access Unix file servers
* atalkd - an implementation of the AppleTalk protocol
* papd - a print server that enables Macintosh computers to access printers
  connected to Unix servers
* megatron - a tool to convert files in Macintosh specific formats like
  BinHex, AppleSingle, or MacBinary into files readable by Unix computers
* various supporting programs and utilities
