Netatalk 2.2.1
==============

The Netatalk development team is proud to announce version 2.2.1 of
the Netatalk File Sharing suite. This is the first update to the new 2.2
release series. All users are encouraged to upgrade their systems to 2.2.1.

Netatalk is a freely-available Open Source AFP fileserver. It also
provides a kernel level implementation of the AppleTalk Protocol Suite.
A *NIX/*BSD system running Netatalk is capable of serving many Macintosh
clients simultaneously as an AppleShare file server (AFP), AppleTalk
router, *NIX/*BSD print server, and for accessing AppleTalk printers via
Printer Access Protocol (PAP).
Included are a number of minor printing and debugging utilities.

The suite contains:

* afpd - a file server that implements the Apple Filing Protocol, allowing
  clients running MacOS to access Unix file servers
* atalkd - an implementation of the AppleTalk protocol
* papd - a print server that enables Macintosh computers to access printers
  connected to Unix servers
* megatron - a tool to convert files in Macintosh specific formats like
  BinHex, AppleSingle, or MacBinary into files readable by Unix computers
* various supporting programs and utilities

Summary of hot stuff and enhancements in 2.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* AFP 3.3 support (necessary for TimeMachine and Lion)
* Robust network disconnect/reconnect, especially important for Time Machine
* Support for fast AFP searches (CNID backend "dbd" only)
* POSIX draft 1e ACL support
* Complete Netatalk volume compatible `ad` file utility suite
* Dynamic filesystem cache
* Builtin Zeroconf registration of the AFP server and TimeMachine volumes
* Support for ACLs without a common Directory Service between server and client

Important
~~~~~~~~~

The enhancements for fast AFP searches are only implemented for the CNID backend "dbd"
and require changes to the underlying CNID database, ie an additional index.
This breaks drop-in compatibility between the CNID backends "cdb" and "dbd". Once "dbd"
has upgraded a CNID database of a volume, "cdb" will reject to open it.

Changes in 2.2.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* NEW: afpd: disable continous service feature by default, new option
       -keepsessions to enable it
* NEW: configure option "--enable-redhat-systemd" for Fedora15 and later.

       1) ACL support compiled in, 2) the volume supports ACLs, 3) the new
       volume option "noacls" is not set for the volume.
       The previous behaviour was to enable ACL support for a volume if
       1) it was compiled in and 2) the volume supported ACLs. There was no way
       to disable ACLs for a volume.
* UPD: afpd: add a configurable hold time option to FCE file modification event
       generation, default is 60 s, new option "fceholdfmod" to change it

       to chdir back to the original working directory
* FIX: cnid_dbd: increase BerkeleyDB locks and lockobjs
* FIX: cnid_dbd: implement -d option, deletes CNID db
* FIX: dbd: better detection of local (or SMB/NFS) modifications on AFP volumes
* FIX: suse: initscript return better status
* FIX: Sourcecode distribution: add missing headers
* FIX: Solaris 10: missing dirfd replacement function

       directory service, by mapping ACLs to UARight
