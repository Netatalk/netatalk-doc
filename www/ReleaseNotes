Netatalk 2.2-beta3
==================
The Netatalk development team is proud to announce version 2.2-beta3 of
the Netatalk File Sharing suite. This is an unstable version, published
for the sole purpose of receiving wider testing. Do not run this on
production systems.

Netatalk is a freely-available Open Source AFP fileserver. It also
provides a kernel level implementation of the AppleTalk Protocol Suite.
A *NIX/*BSD system running Netatalk is capable of serving many Macintosh
clients simultaneously as an AppleShare file server (AFP), AppleTalk
router, *NIX/*BSD print server, and for accessing AppleTalk printers via
Printer Access Protocol (PAP).
Included are a number of minor printing and debugging utilities.

The suite contains:

* afpd - a file server that implements the Apple Filing Protocol, allowing
  clients running MacOS to access Unix file servers
* atalkd - an implementation of the AppleTalk protocol
* papd - a print server that enables Macintosh computers to access printers
  connected to Unix servers
* megatron - a tool to convert files in Macintosh specific formats like
  BinHex, AppleSingle, or MacBinary into files readable by Unix computers
* various supporting programs and utilities

Summary of hot stuff and enhancements since 2.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* AFP 3.3 support
* Robust network disconnect/reconnect, especially important for Time Machine
* Support for fast AFP searches (CNID backend "dbd" only)
* POSIX draft 1e ACL support
* Complete Netatalk volume compatible `ad` file utility suite
* Dynamic filesystem cache
* Builtin Zeroconf registration of the AFP server and TimeMachine volumes
* Support for ACLs without a common Directory Service between server and client

Important
~~~~~~~~~

The enhancements for fast AFP searches are only implemented for the CNID backend "dbd"
and require changes to the underlying CNID database, ie an additional index.
This breaks drop-in compatibility between the CNID backends "cdb" and "dbd". Once "dbd"
has upgraded a CNID database of a volume, "cdb" will reject to open it.

Changes in 2.2-beta3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* FIX: afpd: fix option volsizelimit to return a usefull value for the
       volume free space using `du -sh` with popen
* FIX: afpd: fix idle connection disconnects
* FIX: afpd: don't disconnect sessions for clients if boottimes don't match
* FIX: afpd: better handling of very long filenames that contain many
       multibyte UTF-8 glyphs

Changes in 2.2-beta2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* NEW: afpd: AFP 3.3
* UPD: afpd: AFP 3.x can't be disabled

Changes in 2.2-beta1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* FIX: composition of Surrogate Pair
* UPD: gentoo,suse,cobalt,tru64: inistscript name is "netatalk", not "atalk"
* UPD: gentoo: rc-update install don't hook in the Makefile

Changes in 2.2alpha5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* UPD: afpd: new option "searchdb" which enables fast catalog searches
       using the CNID db.
* UPD: Case-insensitive fast search with the CNID db
* UPD: cnid_dbd: afpd now passes the volume path, not the db path when
       connecting for a volume. cnid_dbd will read the
       ".AppleDesktop/.volinfo" file of the volume in order to figure
       out the CNID db path and the volume charset encoding.

Changes in 2.2alpha4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* NEW: Enhanced CNID "dbd" database for fast name search support.
       Important: this makes cnidscheme "cdb" incompatible with "dbd".
* NEW: afpd: support for fast catalog searches
* NEW: ad utility: ad find
* UPD: afpd: CNID database versioning check for "cdb" scheme
* UPD: cnid_dbd: CNID database versioning and upgrading. Additional
       CNID database index for fast name searches.


Changes in 2.2alpha3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* FIX: afpd: various fixes
* FIX: Any daemon did not run if atalkd doesn't exist (redhat/debian)

Changes in 2.2alpha2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* FIX: afpd: fix compilation error when ACL support is not available
* FIX: Ensure Appletalk manpages and config files are distributed

Changes in 2.2alpha1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* NEW: ad utility: ad cp
* NEW: ad utility: ad rm
* NEW: ad utility: ad mv
* NEW: afpd: dynamic directoy and CNID cache (new config option -dircachesize)
* NEW: afpd: POSIX 1e ACL support
* NEW: afpd: automagic Zeroconf registration with avahi, registering both
       the service _afpovertcp._tcp and TimeMachine volumes with _adisk._tcp.
* UPD: afpd: ACLs usable (though not visible on the client side) without common
       directory service, by mapping ACLs to UARight
* UPD: afpd: performance improvements for ACL access calculations
* UPD: AppleTalk ist disabled by default at configuration time. If needed
       use configure switch --enable-ddp.
* FIX: afpd: Solaris 10 compatibilty fix: don't use SO_SNDTIMEO/SO_RCVTIMEO,
       use non-blocking IO and select instead.
* FIX: cnid_dbd: Solaris 10 compatibilty fix: don't use SO_SNDTIMEO/SO_RCVTIMEO,
       use non-blocking IO and select instead.
* REM: afile/achfile/apple_cm/apple_mv/apple_rm: use ad

Supported Platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As of Netatalk 2.2 the following operating systems are supported:

 * FreeBSD
 * Linux
 * OpenBSD
 * NetBSD
 * [Open]Solaris
 * Tru64 (TCP only)

Netatalk may compile and run on other operating systems as well, but
it is not well-tested on those.  We welcome patches and suggestions
for enhancing the portability of Netatalk as well as success and failure
stories.  Please write to netatalk-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.
