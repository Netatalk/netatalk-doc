      <title>The early years</title>

      <para>Back in 1984 Apple copied the main concepts of the so called
      &#34;Cambridge Ring&#34;<indexterm><primary>Cambridge Ring</primary><secondary>AppleTalk&#39;s
      predecessor</secondary></indexterm>, the network technology developed
      mainly by Andy Hopper for Acorn<indexterm><primary>Acorn</primary><secondary>Developed
      AppleTalk basics</secondary></indexterm> together with the University of
      Cambridge.</para>

      <para>Different machines were interconnected via daisy-chaining in a bus
      topology with a maximum speed of 230 Kbps. From a today&#39;s point of
      view a very slow implementation. Farallon<indexterm><primary>Farallon</primary><secondary>One

      alternative to the classic LocalTalk cabling, called PhoneNet<indexterm><primary>PhoneNet</primary><secondary>LocalTalk

      allowed a star topology via Hubs, too.</para>

      <para>Later, additional physical layers have been added like
      Ethernet/IEEE 802.3 (EtherTalk)<indexterm><primary>EtherTalk</primary><secondary>AppleTalk

      <title>Naming conventions change</title>

      <para>To be able to differentiate between the different physical
      transport layers, Apple changed the naming conventions. What has been
      known as &#34;AppleTalk&#34; before, is called &#34;LocalTalk&#34; from
      then on. &#34;AppleTalk&#34; itself is a synonym for Apple&#39;s
      networking techniques in general, including several underlying physical
      layers (see above) up to higher-level protocols that provide file and
      print services (see below)</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>LocalTalk&#39;s heritage</title>

      <para>Due to the slow transmission speed of the original AppleTalk
      implementation, a packet size<indexterm><primary>Packet size</primary><secondary>maximum
      size of an AppleTalk packet</secondary></indexterm> of maximum 586 bytes
      has been chosen. This small packet size has been adopted to the other
      physical layers as well (making it possible to route AppleTalk packets
      via routers between segments using different physical media
      transparently).</para>

      <para>What has been a good compromise for LocalTalk turned into one main
      disadvantage of AppleTalk on other physical media: The inability to use
      the underlying network characteristics in an efficient way (an Ethernet
      frame is 1500 bytes large, for example)</para>

      <para>With the increase of physical transfer speed (100 Mbps with
      &#34;Fast Ethernet&#34; for example) the need for alternatives grew more
      and more. Apple decided to add different transportation layers for file
      services (Apple Filing Protocol). In the mid 90s they developed a
      generic &#34;Data Stream Interface&#34; (DSI) as an abstraction layer to
      be able to use AppleTalk over more efficient protocols like TCP.</para>

      <para>For most of their customers nothing changed, because the Apple
      engineers integrated the ability to automagically switch between
      AppleTalk and TCP. People still used the chooser and AppleTalk to
      connect to the server but in case, both client and server were able to
      &#34;speak&#34; AFP over TCP, they changed the protocol without
      notifying the user.</para>
